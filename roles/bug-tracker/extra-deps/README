This directory declares gem dependencies of Redmine plugins in use.

Only update "Gemfile" manually (by merging the contents of the Gemfiles of the
plugins being installed). Then run update.sh in the right "nix develop"
environment to regenerate Gemfile.lock and gemset.nix:

$ nix develop .#redmine-extra-deps-update -c ./update.sh
