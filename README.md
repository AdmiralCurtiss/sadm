Dolphin System Administration Repository
========================================

This repository (and its wiki) contain all the required informations to
bootstrap a new instance of the services that support the Dolphin Emulator
project. Currently the following services are documented:

* Buildbot
* Development versions downloads
* Git changes detector
* Symbol server

Each service has a Wiki page and a directory in this Git repository if some
files are needed.
